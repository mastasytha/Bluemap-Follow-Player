# Bluemap-Follow-Player
A drop‑in script that makes your BlueMap viewer automatically follow a specific player by UUID or by name via simple URL parameters. It includes a resilient player‑marker resolver (handles dashed/undashed UUIDs, varying marker keys/fields) and a small localStorage cache to speed up name lookups.
